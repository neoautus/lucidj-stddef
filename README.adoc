== Prerequisites for Building

* Java Development Kit 8 or later
* Ant (minimun Ant 1.8.0)

== Before Starting

The examples were built to illustrate both functionality and implementation. They are IDE-agnostic, showing all the steps to build an OSGi application from zero without need of a particular combination of IDE and plugin or any wizzard tool.

We achieve this using Ant. Today, you can also use Maven to build any OSGi project, however Maven is magical in it's own way, because there are many predefined (and sane) defaults. You may choose Maven for your own projects. On the other side, Ant allows you to follow the logic of building an OSGi jar file, with all required steps very visible. We strongly suggest you to take a time to look into `build.xml` and `configure.xml` to get a good idea of whats going on, and how things are being done. It may look intimidating at first, but hopefully will also be instructive.

Specially, you will get known to `Bnd` (http://bndtools.org/), which is *the* reference tool to build all OSGi-related stuff you can imagine. There's also the iPojo processor, which manipulates the code after compilation and demonstrates the post-processing of OSGi jar bundles.

=== Building

TODO: Add instructions for building.

To build _all_ subprojects at once, just type `ant` on project root.

By default, Ant will download and cache all needed tools, then invoke the `build-all` target. The output of all builds will be located in `dist/` directory beneath every subproject. Karaf stage, will be built by default, so all bundles will be deployed into Karaf. If you change the stage to Felix (changing the stage target to Felix all bundles will

=== Useful Ant targets

For details on building the code, see `ant -p`.

These are the available targets:

* `ant build-all`: builds all available subprojects;
* `ant clean`: removes the `build` and `dist` directories;
* `ant zero`: same as `clean`, but also removes the `cache` directory with all downloaded tools;
* `ant configure`: rebuild the library and tools cache.
